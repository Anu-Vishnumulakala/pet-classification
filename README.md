# pet-classification
This project focuses on classifying pet images using a deep learning model trained to identify pet faces from input images. The model is saved as an H5 file and is used to make predictions on new images through a Python inference script.
## Project Overview
The system takes an input image of a pet, preprocesses it to match the model requirements, and predicts the corresponding pet category. This project demonstrates the complete workflow of image preprocessing, model loading, and prediction using a trained neural network.
## Key Components
- Trained Model (pet_face_classifier.h5)
A pre-trained deep learning model used for pet face classification.
- Prediction Script (predict_pet.py)
Loads the model, preprocesses the input image, and outputs the prediction.
- Test Image (test_pet.jpg)
Sample image used to validate and test the model predictions.
